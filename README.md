### Project Description
This project is a two-part chaotic signup form designed as a frustratingly fun experience. It starts with a gauntlet of moving inputs and a fleeing checkbox, followed by a second page where every text field is locked. To proceed, users must complete a unique minigame for each field, transforming a simple signup into an absurd test of patience and endurance.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It's the user's lack of patience

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution, which nobody asked for, is to make the signup process more tedious.
